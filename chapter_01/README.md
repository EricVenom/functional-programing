When thinking about an application’s design, ask yourself the following questions in terms of these design principles:
- *Extensibility* — Do I constantly refactor my code to support additional functionality?
- *Easy to modularize* — If I change one file, is another file affected?
- *Reusability* — Is there a lot of duplication?
- *Testability* — Do I struggle to unit test my functions?
- *Easy to reason about* — Is my code unstructured and hard to follow?
